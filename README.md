## **Workspace Structure**


### The workspace contains two folders where:

- `/V1_Java`: is the Java version of the exercise, only **Java 17** is required
- `/V2_Javascript_API_REST_nodeJS`: is a JavaScript version using **NodeJS**. This project integrates a **REST API** and **unit testing** to demonstrate a better web structure of how i would implement this exercise

Each of its 2 folders has a README inside explaining how to run the program.

*Thank you for your interest in this exercise.*
